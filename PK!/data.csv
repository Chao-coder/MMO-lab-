பல்லவி : 
டக்கு, முக்கு, டிக்கு-டிக்கு
டக்கு, முக்கு, டிக்குத்தாளம்

ஏய் டக்கு, முக்கு, டிக்கு தாளம்
போடப்போறன்டா!
நம்ம பொண்ணுங்கள ஜிகுஜிகுன்னு 
மாத்தப்போறன்டா!

கொஞ்சம் பவுடரத்தான் போட்டு
பளபளப்ப சேத்து!
எம்புஜ்ஜிப்பொண்ணு வந்துப்புட்டா
சுருசுருப்ப ஏத்து!

- டக்கு, முக்கு, டிக்கு தாளம் 
போடப்போறேன்டா!
நம்ம பொண்ணுங்கள ஜிகுஜிகுன்னு 
மாத்தப்போறேன்டா!

அனுபல்லவி : 
சில்லாக்கி பில்லாக்கி சீனாக்குட்டியே
இந்த மாமாவ வாட்டாதடி சிலோன் ரொட்டியே!
புரோட்டாக்கு சால்னாவ போட்டா சூப்பரு
என்னக் கட்டிப்புடிச்சி கடிச்சிடேன்டி என் ஜிகுஜிகுச்சான்!

சரணம் : 
ஏ வெள்ள வவ்வா இடுப்பு துடுப்புப்போடுது
கவ்வச்சொல்லி வெறிய ஏத்திப்பாக்குது
வெள்ள வவ்வா இடுப்பு துடுப்புப்போடுது
கவ்வச்சொல்லி வெறிய ஏத்திப்பாக்குது

இப்போ கிஸ்சொன்னு தள்ளு,
வடியுது ஜொள்ளு
என்னக் காயவச்சிப் பாக்காதடி
எகிறிடும் பில்லு

இப்போ கிஸ்சொன்னு தள்ளு,
வடியுது ஜொள்ளு
என்னக் காயவச்சிப் பாக்காதடி
எகிறிடும் பில்லு

இப்போ கிஸ்சொன்னு தள்ளு,
வடியுது ஜொள்ளு
என்னக் காயவச்சிப் பாக்காதடி
எகிறிடும் பில்லு

ஏய் நண்பனுங்க ஒண்ணா இருந்தா போதுண்டா 
சொத்து சொகம் வேற எதுக்கு வேணுண்டா 
நீ போவ சொல்ல என்னாத்த எடுத்து போவடா
நாட்ட ஆண்டாலுமே பிரண்ட்ஷிப் இல்லாட்டி வேஸ்ட்டுடா
இதப்புரிஞ்சிட்டா மவுசு திருப்பி வராது வயசு   
துட்டு கெடச்சுதுன்னா ஏதுன்னு மட்டும் கேக்காத பெருசு  
இதப்புரிஞ்சிட்டா மவுசு திருப்பி வராது வயசு   
துட்டு கெடச்சுதுன்னா ஏதுன்னு மட்டும் கேக்காத பெருசு

Street-smart thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago. What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world’s oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate’s long-lost brother...but only if they can learn to work together.

Composer’s Note:
The sounds of ukulele strums and the reggae groove somehow makes me think of holidays, the beach and the times that were spent joyfully, living every moment to its fullest. This music blends with the sights and sounds of Madras seamlessly, to create a perfect canvas for some unadulterated teenage-like fun and to make some memories for life. After all, this is what songs are for.

497,Kaatrilae - Mudhal Nee Mudivum Nee | Darbuka Siva | Nakul Abhyankar | Kaber Vasuki | Super Talkies,2020-12-07,950438,22004,"A trip down the nostalgic lane! #Kaatrilae from #DarbukaSiva's #MudhalNeeMudivumNee is sure to leave you teary-eyed reminiscing your school days! Click play and enjoy this melody now!

Watch the official Tamil lyric video here!

Composer’s Note:
Growing up in the 90s in the Mtv era, I was very influenced by soft rock music with its signature riffing guitars, groovy drums and bass and the fanfare brass and woodwinds. On a meta level, I feel that these sounds represent the rock ’n roll vibe of these school kids as much as it represents the 90s and its sensibilities. It’s a deliberate throwback sound that throws me back into that era.

596,Mudhal Nee Mudivum Nee  - Title Track Lyric | Darbuka Siva | Sid Sriram | Thamarai | Super Talkies,2020-09-02,4009881,93088,"A lilting melody from the famed #DarbukaSiva , #SidSriram and #Thamarai trio!

Composer's Note:

The song Mudhal Nee Mudivum Nee for me is a collage of sounds from various musical soundscapes that relate to nostalgia and the wonderful memories associated with it. 

The Sarod’s classical texture converses with the voice to create that feeling, coupled with strings that form a sonic movement which often plays around with trancy layers of interesting shapes and patterns of sounds.

795,Whispering Hues - Varun Sunil feat Rajhesh Vaidhya| Irena Mihalkovich,2020-02-12,27897,1036,"Are you an alien on this land? 
Tell me, who are you.  
you are the breath of the trees,
you are the colors in the rainbow, 
you are the fragrance of the soil beneath, 
you are the butterfly and the guardian of the night.
you are earth, water and fire. 
Yet you are an alien to me. 
You live in your concrete jungle and call it home.
You torment me to further your own.
You are an alien to your soul. 
Come back to me, 
do you not hear my cries,
do you not hear my whispers in the hues of the black sky,
come back to me.
You are no alien,
You are me and i am you.
